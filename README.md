# awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome

This repository was created to preemptively cut Reddit off from tediously one-upping each other by just increasing the number of "awesome-" prefixes of the last linked repository by one: this is the **longest number of nestings in a repository name that GitHub will allow**. (Anyone inclined to start introducing new notations trying to get around this is invited to skip directly to [final-awesome-above-any-finite-awesome-named-by-a-sub-googol-symbolic-first-order-set-expression][rayo] and call it a day.)

As noted by Sindre's own [awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-awesome-awesome-awesome) (created in reaction to [awesome-awesome-awesome](https://github.com/t3chnoboy/awesome-awesome-awesome)), the root level of curation for "awesome lists" (ie. an "awesome-awesome") is [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#contents).
